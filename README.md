# SRK_Method
SRK Method implemented in Python to calculate fugacity coefficient, fugacity and Pxy diagram for a non-ideal binary mixture. 

This work includes:
- **Properties_Comp.csv file** containing properties for different (but limited) components. Feel free to extend the database! 
  
  *Note:* A,B,C correspond to Antoines' Equation coefficients; whereas the tMin and tMax columns represent the temperature range where those coefficients are valid.
- **CubicEquationSolver.py** created by Shril Kumar (github.com/devojoyti) &  Devojoyti Halder (github.com/devojoyti) to solve the equation for the compressibility factor Z.
- **SRK_functions.py** containg the main calculations of the SRK Method.
- **main.py** as the main program, where the components of the binary mixture are selected and all the calculations take place to obtain the Pxy diagram as the final outcome.

Here is a little tutorial (It's in Spanish tho!):
